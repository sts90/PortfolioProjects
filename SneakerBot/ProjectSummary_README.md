# Project Summary
## Web scraping sneaker bot

### Proficiencies demonstrated: Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, web scraping

I love sneakers but so do a lot of other people. That can have a big impact on availability, making some models harder to find in certain sizes.

This bot was programmed to scrape the Adidas website to list available sizes for specific models of shoes. The code can be altered to search for different models and different browsers. 

Notes have been added throughout the code to explain various functionalities and options for alteration. The code for this bot can be found in the Jupyter Notebook included in this repository.
